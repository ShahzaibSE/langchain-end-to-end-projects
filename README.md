# LangChain End-to-End Solution Monorepo

This repository is a monorepo that contains all the components necessary for an end-to-end solution using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), designed for efficient and scalable language model applications. It is managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a dependency and project management tool. Additionally, it leverages [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) for model integration, making it easy to incorporate open-source language models.

## ðŸ“– What is LangChain?

LangChain is a powerful framework that simplifies building applications that use language models for a variety of use cases, from chatbots and virtual assistants to text analysis and summarization. It provides a high-level abstraction that allows you to link together different components (like prompts, chains, and agents) into a cohesive pipeline, thus making it easier to manage and scale applications built around large language models (LLMs).

### Key Features of LangChain

- **Component-based Architecture**: Chain together multiple components, such as prompts, LLMs, and tools, into complex workflows.
- **Integration with Various LLMs**: Seamlessly integrate with popular language models, including OpenAIâ€™s GPT, Hugging Face models, and custom models.
- **Flexibility**: Customize the pipelines to suit your specific requirements, from data ingestion to response generation.

LangChain is ideal for developers looking to build, manage, and scale language model applications with minimal complexity.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Management with Poetry

This monorepo uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and project management. Poetry is a tool for managing Python dependencies and packaging, making it easier to build and maintain consistent environments across different systems.

### Why Use Poetry?

- **Dependency Management**: Poetry handles dependency resolution, ensuring that all required packages are compatible and up to date.
- **Environment Isolation**: Create isolated virtual environments for the project, reducing conflicts between different dependencies.
- **Simplified Workflow**: Poetry streamlines setup, installation, and publishing, making it ideal for managing complex projects in a monorepo structure.

#### Common Commands

To get started with Poetry:

- **Install Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  
  poetry install
